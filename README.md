# Twitter-Clone
Twitter Clone in Python with Tkinter is a social media simulation with posts, likes, friends, notifications, and search. It uses lists for posts, priority queues for ranking, sets for friends/likes, queues for notifications, and hash maps for searching. The Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm ensures fast text searches.
